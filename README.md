# docspine-demo-commerce

Demo source repository for the Docspine documentation aggregation demo. Contains documentation for services in the **checkout** domain, owned by the **payments** and **fulfillment** teams.

This repo demonstrates that multiple teams can share a repository while Docspine aggregates their docs by domain at build time.
